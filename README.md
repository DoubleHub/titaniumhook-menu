# titaniumhook-menu
Very old TitaniumHook menu source. Contains many bad practices so proceed with caution.

This is not a paste-ready source. This is just a menu coded very badly back in 2014-2015. You still need methods to draw things using PaintTraverse hook.
Hope you can have fun laughing at it!
